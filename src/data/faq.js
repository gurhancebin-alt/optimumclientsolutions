    question: "What services does Optimum Client Solutions offer?",
    answer: "We specialize in three core areas: Website Development (e-commerce platform building, design, custom development), Market & Channel Optimization (marketplace SEO, paid advertising, organic growth), and E-commerce Solutions (product research, competitive intelligence, strategic analysis). Our services are designed for e-commerce entrepreneurs who want data-driven results."
  },
  {
    question: "Who is your ideal client?",
    answer: "We work best with two types of clients: (1) Entrepreneurs launching their first e-commerce business who need professional setup and market validation, and (2) Established sellers looking to scale through data-driven optimization, multi-channel expansion, and strategic intelligence. We don't do generic consulting — we deliver actionable research and implementation."
  },
  {
    question: "What makes your approach different from other agencies?",
    answer: "We don't sell courses, coaching, or motivational content. We deliver structured deliverables — working stores, optimization implementations, and PDF intelligence reports backed by real data. Every recommendation comes with keyword volumes, competitive metrics, and margin calculations. It's execution and research, not advice."
  },
  {
    question: "What platforms do you work with?",

  },
  {
    question: "How do you price your services?",
    answer: "Pricing depends on scope and complexity. Website development projects are quoted per-project based on requirements. Intelligence reports are fixed-price based on research depth. Channel optimization can be project-based or monthly retainer. We provide detailed quotes after an initial consultation to understand your specific needs."
  },
  {
    question: "What's your typical turnaround time?",
    answer: "Timelines vary by service type. Basic store setups take 2-4 weeks. Custom development projects run 4-8 weeks. Intelligence reports are delivered in 3-7 business days depending on depth. We prioritize quality over speed — you're paying for thorough work, not rushed deliverables."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer ongoing support after project completion?",
    answer: "Yes. For website development, we offer maintenance packages for updates, security, and performance monitoring. For optimization services, we offer monthly retainers for continuous improvement. Most clients start with a one-time project to test the fit before committing to ongoing work."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I get started?",
    answer: "The best way to start is through our contact form or by scheduling a consultation call. We'll discuss your goals, assess your current situation, and recommend the right service package. There's no commitment required for the initial conversation."

  },
  {
    question: "How is marketplace optimization different from website SEO?",
