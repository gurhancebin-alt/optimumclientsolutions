## Instructions:

1. **Image Requirements:**
   - Format: JPEG (.jpg or .jpeg)
   - Recommended filename: `background.jpg`
   - Aspect ratio: Square (1:1) - e.g., 1000x1000px, 1500x1500px, 2000x2000px
   - File size: Keep under 500KB for optimal web performance

2. **Upload Instructions:**
   - Copy your square JPEG image to this folder
   - Rename it to `background.jpg` (or update the CSS file if using a different name)
   - The image will automatically display with 15% opacity as a background overlay

3. **CSS Configuration:**
   - The background is configured in `css/style.css`
   - Current setting: `opacity: 0.15` (adjust if needed)
   - Background covers entire viewport with `background-size: cover`

4. **Testing:**
   - After adding the image, open `index.html` in a browser
   - You should see your image as a subtle background behind the content
   - If not visible, check the filename matches `background.jpg`
